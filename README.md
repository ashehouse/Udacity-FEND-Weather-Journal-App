# Udacity-FEND-Weather-Journal-App
 Project 3 for Udacity FEND Nanodegree

This project required me to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.

The user enters in their zip code and current mood and it returns the current weather at their location.
